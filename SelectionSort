/*
This algorithm is from the Data Structure & Algorithm using C++: Zero To Mastery course on Udemy

Paramters: The array, then the number of elements to sort.

The time complexity of this algorithm is n^2.

Development notes, when using this algorithm, when the list is 1 character, might need to account for this. Throws an error.
